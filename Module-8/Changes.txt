Changes to html file:
1: "Boo The Dog Fan Page!" didn't have <h1></h1>
2: Made "Read more at..." it's own paragraph
3: Line 46 the link didn't work correctly no href=""
4: Lines 78-82 - made them a numbered list
5: Lines 94-96 - correctly assigned the function for the button
6: Line 119 - relabeled the source file so the script would work properly

Changes to Javascript:
1: Line 6 - Put quotation marks where needed so that it would only spit out one fact per click instead of the whole thing
2: Put quotation marks around the colors between lines 8 and 17
