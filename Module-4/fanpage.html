    <h2>Bio</h2>
    
    <p>"Post Malone, born as Austin Richard Post, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and record producer. One of the emerging new talents in the hip-hop industry, he is best known for his debut track "White Iverson", a song that peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and was later certified quadruple platinum by RIAA. He is also known for his single "Rockstar" that rose to #1 on the same chart and cemented his position as an upcoming singing star. Born in Syracuse, New York, Malone began playing the guitar at the age of 14 and then went on to create his first mixtape titled ‘Young and After Them Riches’ during his high school years. Since his breakthrough hit single, Malone has worked with many prominent rappers including Young Thug, Kanye West and 50 Cent. Malone’s music has been referred to as a "melting pot of the grunge, country, R&B and hip-hop”. The young singer cities Bob Dylan as his inspiration and calls him "a god" and "a genius" when it comes to music. He is a fan of former President John F. Kennedy and has even got a tattoo of him on one of his arms. According to Malone, Kennedy has been the only president to speak out against corruption."</p>
